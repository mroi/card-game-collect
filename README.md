Card Game Collection Manager
============================

This is a little tool to manage a personal collection of playing card games. I made it 
primarily to learn macOS app development, but the tool is generally usable. In some places, 
the code uses the German terms “Quartette” and “Quartettverwaltung”. Also, I only ever 
maintained the German localization.
